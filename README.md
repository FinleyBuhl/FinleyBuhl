Hi, I'm Finley Buhl, a german student currently in 10th grade. I like to code although I am certainly no expert at it. Mostly I code in Object Pascal, but I'm trying to
get into c#. I tried Python but I hate it because it's slower than Object Pascal and as I love to code algorithms that should be fast I won't use it.
